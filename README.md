# Password Generator

## Description
This project involved adding Javascript to finish completing a password generator. Upon the user clicking the "Generate Password" button, some prompts would pop up asking the user to submit criteria used to generate their password. This criteria included password length, and character types to use in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters). Once the user provided input for all the prompts, a password was generated using Math.floor() and Math.random() functions and then written to the text area on the web page. Basic error handling for the user input prompts is also implemented.
